    * Default to showing processes in the uninterruptable state (D).
    The -z flag no longer affects whether processes in D state are shown.
    The -z flag does still toggle whether zombie (Z) processes are shown.

    * Removed unnecessary check which is always true from init tab parsing.

sysvinit (3.00) released; urgency=low

    * Applied patch from Matthias Schiffer which allows bootlogd to read from
      a wider range of consoles. The console name is already passed in from the
      kernel command line using "console=". We no longer filter out names as strictly
      but do now check to confirm the "console=" device points to a valid TTY.

    * Fixed typos and missing underlines in shutdown manual page.
      Corrections provided by Helge Kreutzmann.

sysvinit (2.98) released; urgency=low

    * Fixed time parsing in shutdown when there is a + in front of a 0 time offset.
      Commands with a positive time offset (+1) would work but +0 fails.
      This has been corrected by Arkadiusz Miskiewicz.

sysvinit (2.97) released; urgency=low

    * Check $(ROOT) filesystem for libcrypt instead of a hardcoded path to /usr.
      Added logsave and readbootlog to list of files git ignores.
      - Patches provided by Petr Ovtchenkov.

    * Code clean-up and making sure we avoid freeing unused memory.
      Patch provided by David Hoyer.

    * Added shell script from Trek which converts systemd unit files
      into init.d style scripts.

    * Added patch from Didier Gaudin which allows init to load configuration
      data from files stored in /etc/inittab.d/

    * Added patch from William Shipley which allows shutdown time to be specified
      in the format +hh:mm. This is in addition to the existing formats such as
      hh:mm, +m, and "now".

    * Fixed typos in manual pages. Submitted by Helge Kreutzmann.


sysvinit (2.96) released; urgency=low

    * Added -z command line parameter to pidof which tells pidof to
      try to find processes in uninterruptible (D) or zombie (Z) states.
      This can cause pidof to hang, but produces a more complete process
      list.
      Closes Savannah bug #56534

    * Reformatted init code to make if/while logic more clear.

    * Cleaned up some output from readbootlog.

    * Added -e flag to bootlogd. When -e is used, data saved
      to the boot log file does not have escape characters
      removed. This means colour and cursor movement codes
      stay in the log file. The may then look nicer when
      read with "less -R', but may appear cluttered or
      out of alignment when viewed with other, plain-text tools.
      When -e is not used, escape characters are removed/filtered.
      Closes Debian bug #672361.

    * Make sure src/Makefile cleans up all executable files
      when parent Makefile calls "make clean".


sysvinit (2.95) released; urgency=low

  [ Jesse Smith ]

    * Fixed various typos and control codes in manual pages.
      Patch provided by Bjarni Ingi Gislason.
    * Dropped "-f" format flag for pidof command as it
      could be used to print information from memory or crash
      pidof. Replaced flag with "-d" which allows for a custom
      separator to be used between listed PIDs.
      Patch supplied by KatolaZ.
    * Updated manual page to describe -h and its modifiers (-H and -P)
      in more detail. Should close Debian bug #374039.
    * Use millisecond delays in init so that shutdown
      can happen without a near-full-second delay after
      all processes have terminated. Replaced do_sleep()
      with do_msleep(), provided by Serge Belyshev.
    * Replaced hardwired sleep constants in init.c with
      defined constants for easy updating in the future.
    * Accepted patch from Luc Gommans which explains why zombie and
      deep sleep processes (Z and D) may be hidden from pidof.
    * Removed link instruction against sepol library from src/Makefile.
      This has no change to the resulting binary, just makes the
      Makefile cleaner.

sysvinit (2.94) released; urgency=low

  [ Jesse Smith ]

    * When the halt command is called with the -p flag (or as poweroff)
      the command now passes the "-h -P" flags to shutdown. This
      in turn sets the INIT_HALT environment variable to POWEROFF.
      Assuming this value is checked by initscripts during the
      shutting down procedure, it should cause the system to
      be powered off.
      If halt is called without -p then the value of INIT_HALT
      is not set and the default action (often set in /etc/default/halt)
      is taken.
    * Removed unnecessary malloc.h includes. Memory allocation
      and freeing is now handled in stdlib.h
    * Added defines for FreeBSD to make some components compile
      on FreeBSD 11.
    * Increased the size of the kernel command line buffer in bootlogd
      from 256 characters to 4096. This size is defined in KERNEL_COMMAND_LENGTH
      for easy modification downstream.
    * Added logsave.c and logsave.8 manual page from e2fsprogs to make
      sure logsave is available to initscripts.
    * Updated src/Makefile to make sure bootlogd compiles with Clang.
    * Use defined constants for password length in sulogin. Makes
      it easier to update/patch later.
    * Minor code fixes across multiple source files to avoid buffer
      overflows, or uninitialized strings.
    * Changed the way the "when" variable is used internally in shutdown.c.
      It starts as a NULL pointer, then might get set as a pointer to optarg,
      then it might get set to point to an argv parameter, then it might have
      a string value copied into it, over-writing the original data. We should
      not risk over-writing internal variables which might get used for something
      else (it's rude and security risk). Set up "when" as its own buffer
      that has data from optargs and/or argv copied into it.
    * Fixed typo in init.8 manual page.
    * Updated text of fstab-decode to explain what the utility does.


sysvinit (2.93) released; urgency=low

  [ Jesse Smith ]

    * Fixed typo in pidof which would prevent the -o (omit PID)
      flag from working.
      Fixes Debian bug ##913394.
    * Fixed error where pidof would not omit checking PIDs passed
      to it when the -o flag was used.
      Fixes Debian bug #913394.


sysvinit (2.92) released; urgency=low

  [ Jesse Smith ]

    * The shutdown and init commands were using different default delays between
      sending processes SIGTERM and SIGKILL - they were 3 and 5 seconds, respectively.
      Unified these on 3 seconds, using a new defined value in init.h.
      Updated shutdown manual page to reflect the change and better explain
      how -t and -n flags work.
      Updated the init manual page with the new default value.
      The updated documentation resolves Debian bug #375274.
    * Remove PC speaker beep from shutdown process in dowall.c.
      Closes Debian bug #614893.
      Patch provided by Andreas Fackler.
    * Removed unused Version variable from wall.c.
    * Updated halt/reboot manual page to acknowledge the -i
      flag may not properly shut down network interfaces if the interface
      does not have an IP address.
      Addresses Debian bug #361935.
    * Applied patch from Daniel Povey which should allow killall5/pidof to
      avoid locking up if it encounters stopped or zombie processes 
      due to broken NFS mount points.
      This should allow Debian bug #719273 to be closed.
    * Applied patch from Regid Ichira to clarify shutdown command
      line options. Updated manual page for shutdown.
      Closes Debian bug #630661.
    * shutdown command was setting environment variable INIT_HALT to 
      "POWERDOWN", this should have been "POWEROFF" as specified in the
      manual page. Fixed code to match manual page and init scripts.
      Closes Debian bugs #717531 and #590895
    * Added -l flag to "last" command. When used it allows "last" to
      display usernames longer than 8 characters long.
    * Added -q and -Q flags to shutdown command to make the "system is going down"
      message appear less often. The -q flag causes messages to only appear at the
      10 minute, 5 minute and x-hour intervals.
      The -Q flag maintains complete silence up until the final "now" warning.
    * Mention GRUB as a potential boot loader in init page since LILO is
      rarely used anymore, outside of Slackware.
    * Swapped out ECHOPRT for ECHOE in stty settings when init brings up
      emergency console. Should make backspace-erasing characters work
      more naturally.
      Closes Debian bug #402847.
    * Updated src/Makefile to make sure we build all the software before
      attempting to install.
    * Removed typos from pidof manual page and killall5 page.
      Closes Debian bugs #815839, #905245 and #890478
    * Added -f <format> option to pidof program to allow printf
      style formatting.
      Closes Debian bug #571590
      Thanks to Philipp Marek for the patch.
    * Added new tool (readbootlog) which will read the /var/log/boot file
      produced by bootlogd. The output is displayed cleaned up so there
      are no control characters. This avoids the need to use sed or related
      tools to try to clean up the contents of the log.
    * Added manual page for readbootlog program. Updated bootlogd page
      to reference it. Closes Debian bug #725123.
    * Updated the shutdown manual page to try to make it more clear
      where we are talking about an initscript called halt or the halt
      program. Likewise whether we are talking about the shutdown process
      or the specific shutdown program.
      Should address Debian bug #374039.
    * Added patch from Samuel Thibault to make project compile
      on Hurd branch of Debian.

    * Adjusted order of compile flags to make it easier for downstream
      to adjust optimization level. Patch provided by Matias Fonzo.
      Can now set optimization level in CFLAGS variable.
    * Added --version command line flag to display current version info.
      Updated manual page for init.8 to match.
    * Version information is now fetched and defined by the Makefile.
      No more need to update the version manually in the init.c source.
    * The init process now writes the current runlevel to /var/run/runlevel.
      This information can be read by the "runlevel" command as well as "halt"
      and "reboot". Having the information logged in /var/run/runlevel as
      well as the utmp file means systems without utmp (like those running
      the musl C library) can still check the current runlevel. This is
      useful when running halt/reboot as these programs want to check the
      runlevel.
    * Added patch from Walter Harms which allows pidof to run without
      displaying output. In this mode pidof simply returns true or false
      without displaying PID values.
      Updated manual page with new -q (quiet) mode.
      Added -h flag for pidof, which was recognized before, but not used.
      The -h flag now displays brief usage information for pidof.
    * Added check for kernel parameter init.autocon=1. If this exists, then
      init will try to open its own console. If not, then any console=
      parameters will be ignored. This avoids conflicts with native kernel
      created consoles.

  [ Jesse Smith ]
    * Updated some comments in init.c to answer questions or
      remove old notes we no longer need.
    * Removed unneeded "count" variable in utmpdump.c.
    * Fixed typo in accidental wrote_wtmp_rlevel == 0 || wrote_wtmp_rlevel 
      comparison so the latter is wrote_utmp_rlevel.
    * Simplified logic in mountpoint.c when testing for same device or same inode.
      Thanks to David Binderman for pointing out the above three issues.
    * When we run shutdown and then the computer is put to sleep, the
      shutdown command recognizes time has passed and continues its
      countdown taking the time lapse into consideration. This prevents
      longer waits if we slept past the time we should have shutdown.
      Accurate to the nearest minute.
      Closes Savannah bug #36279.
    * Added document article and manual page for the initctl (/run/initctl)
      named pipe. Makes it easier for people to communicate with and
      extend communication to init.
    * Added check that named pipe is open before trying to close it
      when something goes wrong or we receive SIGUSER1. Avoids potential
      crash if we receive SIGUSR1 while pipe is not open.
    * Added new signal handler for SIGUSR2. When init receives SIGUSR2
      it closes (and leaves closed) the named pipe /run/initctl. This
      can be used to make sure init does not have any files open. However,
      it also means we cannot switch run levels or bring down the system.
      The pipe can be re-opened by sending init the SIGUSR1 signal.
    * Added "Fall through" comments to some switch statements where multiple
      approaches are tried in order to prevent warnings from GCC 7 (and newer).
      (Thanks to Matias Fonzo for this fix.)
    * Added includes on Linux for sys/sysmacros.h as the old defines in
      the sys/types.h file will be removed in the future.
      (Thanks to Matias Fonzo for this fix.)
    * Removed old LSM file.
      Added .gitignore files to avoid git tracking object files.
      Removed old start-stop-daemon from contrib directory.
      (Patches provided by Guillem Jover.)
    * Cleaned up most warnings generated by GCC 7 & 8. We still
      get some from faulty "nonstring" reports, but silencing them on
      GCC 8 results in more warnings on GCC 7 and Clang, so leaving them
      for now.
    * Fixed compile error on Fedora 28 where crypt() will not link due to
      undocumented dependency change.
    * Updated Makefile to make sure correct version number and correct
      version of files are used. Makefile was pulling from master to create
      tarballs with old version information when trying to create beta
      snapshot.
    * Updated version information in init.c
    * Updated compiler flag from -fstack-protector to -fstack-protector-strong
      for better protection.
    * Cleaned up toplevel Makefile so it stops creating unnecessary temporary
      directories.
    * Fixed typo in mountpoint.c. Patch provided by Radostin Stoyanov.


sysvinit (2.89) world; urgency=low

  [ Jesse Smith ]
    * Updated mountpoint command with -p flag. The -p flag causes
      mountpoint to search for circular mount points. For example, if
      /a/b/c/d is a mount point for /a/b then the former is a valid
      mount point. This only works on Linux since it uses /proc/mounts.
      Updated manual page to match. This fix closes Savannah bug #37114.
    * Removed two sleep calls when we are doing sync anyway to make sure
      data is being written. Speeds up reboot time by about two seconds.
    * Fixed Clang compiler warning regarding variable data parameters to sprintf().
    * Updated top-level Makefile to work with git repo instead of old svn repo.
    * Removed unused variables and findtty() function in bootlogd
    * Add checks to return code for fscanf() called in init.c.
      This mostly just cleans up compiler warnings.
    * Perform error check on setuid() call as suggested in manual page.
    * Fix typo in killall5.c
      Move initscript sample file from "src" to "doc" directory and updated
      Makefile to match.
    * Allow multiple console output
    When booting a kernel with multiple serial console support, or multuiple
    console arguments ala "console=tty1 console=ttyS0,9600" the kernel will output
    messages to all consoles, init however will not. It will only send output to,
    and accept input from, the last of the consoles.
    This patch fixes it.
    (Patch provided by Martin Buck.)
    * Added Patch from Debian developer Mats Erik Andersson to make
    ioctl work on GNU/kFreeBSD. Patches bootlogd.
    * Added Robert Millan's Debian patch to set TERM variable to xterm (instead
    of cons25) when running on GNU/kFreeBSD.
    * Added Robert Millan's Debian patch to use /run/initctl as the named
    pipe for communicating. This works around a limitation on the kFreeBSD
    branch which prevents us from using /dev/initctl for pipes.
    * Confirmed we have applied Guillem Jover's patch to make
    ifdown work on FreeBSD.
    * Confirmed we have Debian patch to fix enabling SELinux.
    (Credit to Petter Reinholdtsen)
    * Confirmed we have Debian patch to make sure utf-8 flag is not cleared from tty.
    (Credit to Samuel Thibault)
    * Confirmed we have Roger Leigh's Makefile patch to allow building
    with multiarch libcrypt.
    * Applied Justus Winter's symlink patch to make sure killall5
    builds and runs on Hurd.
    * Confirmed we have Werner Fink's PATH_MAX patch for getting
    killall5 to build on Hurd.
    * Made sure we have Petter Reinholdtsen's patch to init.c which
    allows init to build on GNU/kFreeBSD despite missing VSWTC.
     * Dropping Debian patch to use /run/nologin instead of /etc/nologin in paths.h.
    Seems every distribution uses a different location. Oracle uses /etc/nologin,
    CentOS seems to use /var/run/nologin.
    We will use /etc/nologin and let distros patch to suit their own preference.
    * Updated halt.8 man page with corrections from
    Christoph Anton Mitterer.
    * Confirmed we have applied patch from Bjarni Ingi Gislason
    which fixes typo in fstab-decode man page.
    * Applied Debian patch to allow init to build on GNU Hurd.
    (Credit: Roger Leigh)
    * Confirmed we have Debian patch from developer Johannes Truschnigg
    which informs the user of field size limit.
    * Applied patch from Debian to the init manual page (init.8)
    to better address runlevels. (Author unknown)
    * The pidof command used to discover the correct PID of
    a process even if the wrong path was given. For example
    pidof /wrongpath/sleep would find the PID of a command run as "sleep".
    This bug was reported on Launchpad for Ubuntu and on Savannah.
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sysvinit/+bug/1546126
    http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?47196
    This bug appears to have been fixed in the development branch,
    allowing these bugs to be tested/closed.
    * Confirmed Savannah bug #37114 (mountpoint does not detect
    mount points using --bind on same file system) still exists,
    but fixed in Debian and Red Hat.
    Considering this bug closed since distributions are using
    util-linux's mountpoint program and ours is no longer
    built/used by default.
    Considered importing util-linux mountpoint but that would duplicate
    effort and pull in a new dependency on libmount.
    * Problem with pidof breaks after prelink (Savannah bug #34992)
    fixed. Patch supplied by Dave Dykstra.
    * Patch to automatically spawn a getty on kernel consoles
    The feature is useful for developers and admins that occasionally need
    to boot with e.g. console=ttyS0.
    The built in default can be overridden via inittab for each device. An
    entry like "S0::off:" turns off the getty on ttyS0.
    characters in log file. Also makes parsing easier.
    This should close Savannah bug report 36528.

    bootlogd and avoid printing uninitialized "buf" variable when
    consolename() fails.

  * Correct fix for Debian bug #547073: use IUTF8 flag if defined
    and if already set to make sure the utf-8 flag is not cleared
    from the tty. Patch from Samuel Thibault.
  * Include limits.h in killall.c to enforce definition of PATH_MAX
  * Fix sysvinit bug #29758 Linker invocation should not contain

    otherwise initialize SELinux and load the policy. Patch from
    Petter Reinholdtsen.
  * Make quotes visible in example of the manual page of fstab-decode
  * Sulogin: enforce reconnection of stdin/stdout/stderr if a device
    was specified.
  * Sulogin: if zero is read at reading the passwd guess it's done.
  * Sulogin: respect byte order that is do not mix chars and ints
  * Shutdown: use PATH_DEFAULT as suggested by Paul Arthur in local bug #36101
  * Killall5/pidof: handle strange names of executables (local bug #36252)
  * Sulogin: be aware the crypt(3) may fail (local bug #36313)

    kernel 3.0 and above
  * Improve message printed when signaling processes to stop.
    Patch from Matias A. Fonzo at the dragora project.
  * Rename internal functions warn() and shutdown() in the shutdown
    binary to avoid surprising dynamic library name resolution
    conflict with NSS modules.  Patch from Richard Tollerton.
  * Try harder to find libcrypt.*, even if there is no static library
    available.  Also look in /usr/lib/*/ for the library, to handle
    Debian multiarch systems.  Based on patch from Andrew Gregory.
  * Adjust included headers to be compatible with the musl C
    library.  Patch from Matias A. Fonzo and Dragora.
  * Move dovoid() macro from #ifdef__GLIBC__ to #ifdef __linux__,
    to match the condutions of the place where it is used.  Thanks
    to Matias A. Fonzo for noticing.
  * Define _XOPEN_SOURCE when building to get crypt() from <unistd.h>
    instead of using <crypt.h> in sulogin.c, to get the source building
    with the musl C library.
  * Use sysconf(_SC_SYMLOOP_MAX) instead of MAXSYMLINKS.  If sysconf
    returns an error, fall back to MAXSYMLINKS on platforms that
    define it.  Fixes build on Hurd.  Patch from Justus Winter and
    Debian.
  * Adjust makefile to make it easier to link all binaries statically.
    Patch from Matias A. Fonzo and Dragora.
  * Rewrite findtty() in bootlogd.c to not chance working directory, to

  * Rewrite findtty() in bootlogd to recursively search /dev/ for the
    correct device, to handle terminal devices for example in /dev/pty/.
    Patch from Debian.
  * Make sure bootlogd findpty() returns an error value when it fails to
    find a usable pty.  Patch from Rob Leslie via Debian.
  * Make sure bootlogd fflush() every line, even if asked not to flush
    to disk using fdatasync().  Patch from Scott Gifford via Debian.
  * Add compatibility code to handle old path "/etc/powerstatus" for a
    while.
  * Include definition for MNT_DETACH which is missing in older GNU libc
    headers.
  * Do not strip binaries before installing them, to make it easier to
    get binaries with debug information installed.

  [ Werner Fink ]
  * Add the comment from Andrea Arcangeli about the correct
    place of setting the default childhandler within spawn().
  * Make sure that newline is printed out for last(1) even
    if an utmp record entry is truncated.
  * Check if utmp not only exists but also is writable and delay
    writing out of the utmp runlevel record if utmp is not writable.
  * Be able to find libcrypt also on 64 bit based architectures.
  * Add option -w to the last command to display the full user and
    domain names in the output.  Patch from Petr Lautrbach.
  * Add a manual page for utmpdump as this tool is sometimes
    very useful even if not intended for normal use.
  * Use paths.h macros for wall
  * Change path "/etc/powerstatus" to "/var/run/powerstatus"
  * Detected also removable block devices at halt/reboot to be able
    to flush data and send them the ATA standby command.  This should
    avoid data loss on USB sticks and other removable block devices.
  * Flush block devices on halt/reboot if not done by the kernel.
  * Set SHELL to /bin/sh in the environmant of shutdown.
  * Retry to write out shutdown messages if interrupted.
  * pidof/killall5 - make omit pid list a dynamic one.
  * pidof - provide '-n' to skip stat(2) syscall on network based FS.
  * init - avoid compiler warnings
  * init - initialize console by using the macros from ttydefaults.h
  * init - add the possibility to ignore further interrupts from keyboard
  * init - add the possibility to set sane terminal line settings
  * sulogin - add the possibility to reset the terminal io
  * Fix some minor problems
  * init - enable is_selinux_enabled() to detect selinuxfs
  * Add fix for Debian bug #536574 -- Can be enabled by -DACCTON_OFF
  * Add helper program fstab-decode to make it easier to handle
    /etc/mtab content. Patch by Miloslav Trmac and Fedora.
  * Add fix for Debian bug #335023 - Make sure TERM is set on FreeBSD.
  * Add fix for Debian bug #374038 - Make it clear that shutdown -c can
    only cancel a waiting shutdown, not an active one.
  * Add note to pidof manual page about the use of readlink(2). Patch by
    Bill Nottingham and Fedora.
  * Add PAM patch contrib/notify-pam-dead.patch based on Debian bug
    #68621, which will add PAM support for programs spawned by init on
    the console like sulogin. Based on patch by Topi Miettinen.  This
    patch is not applied by default yet while we review its
    usefulness.  It is only helpful for session handling, as sulogin
    do not use and will not use a PAM conv() function.  The current
    sulogin is able to handle DES as well as MD5, SHA, and Blowfish
    encrypted passwords due using getpwnam(3).
  * Move utmp/wtmp before the execvp() in spawn() to be sure to
    use the correct pid even on a controlling tty
  * Remaining problem is that the pid of the second fork() for
    getting a controlling tty isn't that reported by spawn()
  * Re-enable writing utmp/wtmp for boot scripts
  * Extend sulogin to support additional encryption algorithms
  * Re-enable maintenance message of sulogin
  * Enable the sulogin fallback password check to handle  MD5, SHA, and
    Blowfish encrypted passwords in case of getpwnam(3) fails.
  * sulogin picking the SELinux context was broken. Patch by Daniel Walsh

    some pids during shutdown.  Based on patch from Colin Watson and
    Ubuntu.
  * Add references between killall5 and pidof manual pages.  Patch from Debian.
  * Modify killall to work better with user space file system, by
    changing cwd to /proc when stopping and killing processes, and
    avoiding stat() when the value isn't used.  Also, lock process
    pages in memory to avoid paging when user processes are stopped.
    Patch from Debian and Goswin von Brederlow with changes by Kel
    Modderman.
  * Change shutdown to only accept flags -H and -P with the -h flag,
    and document this requirement in the manual page.

  * Fixed up bootlogd to read /proc/cmdline. Also keep an internal
    linebuffer to process \r, \t and ^H. It is becoming usable.
  * Applied trivial OWL patches
  * Block signals in syslog(), since syslog() is not re-entrant
    (James Olin Oden <joden@malachi.lee.k12.nc.us>, redhat bug #97534)
  * Minor adjustments so that sysvinit compiles on the Hurd 
  * killall5 now skips kernel threads
  * Inittab entries with both 'S' and other runlevels were broken.
    Fix by Bryan Kadzban <bryan@kadzban.is-a-geek.net>
  * Changed initreq.h to be more flexible and forwards-compatible.
  * You can now through /dev/initctl set environment variables in
    init that will be inherited by its children. For now, only
    variables prefixed with INIT_ can be set and the maximum is
    16 variables. There's also a length limit due to the size
    of struct init_request, so it should be safe from abuse.
  * Option -P and -H to shutdown set INIT_HALT=POWERDOWN and
    INIT_HALT=HALT as environment variables as described above
  * Add "mountpoint" utility.
  * Slightly better algorithm in killall5.c:pidof()
  * Added some patches from fedora-core (halt-usage, last -t,
    sulogin-message, user-console)

  field of inittab, for getties that want to do
  their own utmp/wtmp housekeeping (kludge!).

  and reckognizes the 'auto' argument. (Sets the
  environment variable AUTOBOOT to YES)

- Now using 'pseudo levels' # & * for SYSINIT & BOOT
- Added a new type of 'action', called leave. This
  process will be executed when the system goes from a
  runlevel specified in it's runlevel field to a 
  level that's not. Nice to bring down NFS and the like.

2.1 28-Jan-93
- Fixed a bug with 'boot' and 'once'.
- Check 'initdefault' for validity.
- Reckognizes "single" as command line argument.

  version number.

  run standalone for test purposes.

  and added 'waitpid' instead of 'wait' for SYSV.

1.1, 30-Apr-92
- Read manual wrong: there is no 'action' field called
  process, but all entries are of type process. Every
  'process' get exec'ed by /bin/sh -c 'exec command'.
- Rapidly respawning processes are caught in the act.
- _SYSV support is really Linux support,
  done by poe@daimi.aau.dk on 25-Mar-92.

 1.0, 01-Feb-92
- Initial version, very primitive for the Minix
  operating system. Required some mods. to the
  kernel.
