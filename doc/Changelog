sysvinit (2.86) cistron; urgency=low

  * Fixed up bootlogd to read /proc/cmdline. Also keep an internal
    linebuffer to process \r, \t and ^H. It is becoming useable.
  * Applied trivial OWL patches
  * Block signals in syslog(), since syslog() is not re-entrant
    (James Olin Oden <joden@malachi.lee.k12.nc.us>, redhat bug #97534)
  * Minor adjustements so that sysvinit compiles on the Hurd 
  * killall5 now skips kernel threads
  * Inittab entries with both 'S' and other runlevels were broken.
    Fix by Bryan Kadzban <bryan@kadzban.is-a-geek.net>
  * Changed initreq.h to be more flexible and forwards-compatible.
  * You can now through /dev/initctl set environment variables in
    init that will be inherited by its children. For now, only
    variables prefixed with INIT_ can be set and the maximum is
    16 variables. There's also a length limit due to the size
    of struct init_request, so it should be safe from abuse.
  * Option -P and -H to shutdown set INIT_HALT=POWERDOWN and
    INIT_HALT=HALT as environment variables as described above
  * Add "mountpoint" utility.
  * Slightly better algorithm in killall5.c:pidof()
  * Added some patches from fedora-core (halt-usage, last -t,
    sulogin-message, user-console)

    otherwise there is no way to set a timeout.
  * Removed support for ioctl.save.
  * Turned of support for /etc/initrunlvl and /var/run/initrunlvl
  * Fixed warts in dowall.c ("Dmitry V. Levin" <ldv@altlinux.org>)
  * Fix init.c::spawn(). The "f" variable was used both as file descriptor
    and waitpid(2) return code.  In certain circumstances, this leads to
    TIOCSCTTY with wrong file descriptor (Vladimir N. Oleynik).
  * Fix fd leak in sulogin (Dmitry V. Levin).
  * More error checking in all wait() calling code (Dmitry V. Levin).
  * Fix argv[] initialization in spawn() (Dmitry V. Levin).

  * Change src/Makefile for non-debian systems (mainly, RedHat)
  * Try to create /dev/initctl if not present; check every time to see
    if the dev/ino of /dev/initctl has changed and re-open it. This should
    help devfs a bit.

        'U' flag added to telinit. It forces init to re-exec itself

        May be useful for smoother (heh) upgrades.

  use killall5 instead of kill -1 ....

2.50  14-Feb-1994
- Ignores unknown command line arguments.
- Modelled more after the "real" sysVinit
- Lots of changes all over the place.
  (like showing runlevel in "ps" listing, logging
   runlevel into utmp file etc)
- now using "reliable" signals instead of V7 style.
- Updated all scripts. Examples are in two directories:
  etc (normal) and etc-sysv (sysv style scripts).

  SysVinit-2.4.tar.z.

2.4g 15-May-93

  now "ctrlaltdel" instead of "power{wait,fail}".

2.4a 22-Apr-93
- Fixed last to reckognize BSD style wtmp logging.
- Changed init to write wtmp records that are
  SysV compliant but are also reckognized by the
  BSD last. Added a '+' option to the 'process'
  field of inittab, for getties that want to do
  their own utmp/wtmp housekeeping (kludge!).
- Now accepts a runlevel on the command line,
  and reckognizes the 'auto' argument. (Sets the
  environment variable AUTOBOOT to YES)

2.2.3 24-Mar-93
- Ripped out the 'leave' action. To difficult, and
  unneeded.

2.2 02-Mar-93
- Made wait()'s asynchronous
- Changed whole thing to one big state machine
- Now using 'pseudo levels' # & * for SYSINIT & BOOT
- Added a new type of 'action', called leave. This
  process will be executed when the system goes from a
  runlevel specified in it's runlevel field to a 
  level that's not. Nice to bring down NFS and the like.

2.1 28-Jan-93
- Fixed a bug with 'boot' and 'once'.
- Check 'initdefault' for validity.
- Reckognizes "single" as command line argument.
- Retries execvp with 'sh -c exec ..' if command
  is a shell script. (shouldn't execvp do this?)
- Added patches to use syslog if defined.

2.0 08-Dec-92
- Rewrote the code totally, so started with a new
  version number.
- Dropped Minix support, this code now is Linux - specific.
- With TEST switch on, this init & telinit can
  run standalone for test purposes.

1.3, 05-Jul-92

  to be default under linux. Fixed some typos.

1.2, 16-Jun-92
- Bugreport from Michael Haardt ; removed deadlock
  and added 'waitpid' instead of 'wait' for SYSV.

1.1, 30-Apr-92
- Read manual wrong: there is no 'action' field called
  process, but all entries are of type process. Every
  'process' get exec'ed by /bin/sh -c 'exec command'.
- Rapidly respawning processes are caught in the act.
- _SYSV support is really Linux support,
  done by poe@daimi.aau.dk on 25-Mar-92.

 1.0, 01-Feb-92
- Initial version, very primitive for the Minix
  operating system. Required some mods. to the
  kernel.
