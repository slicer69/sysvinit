If you are not using Debian and the debianized package,
you may have to install the new init by hand if Debian is
using an init system other than SysV (eg systemd). You should
be able to drop the binaries into a Slackware or Devuan system, I think.

The SysV init software, core programs and manual pages can be
installed by running the following two commands from the top-level
source directory.

make
sudo make install

If sudo is not installed, the "make install" command may be run as
the root user.

Other than the GNU make utility, SysV init has few dependencies.
SysV can be built on virtually any Linux system featuring
the GNU C library or musl libc. A C compiler, such as the GNU Compiler
Collection (GCC) or Clang is also required.

Here is a list of preferred directories to install the progs & manpages,
this should be done for you automatically when you run "make install"
as the root user, or via sudo, ie "sudo make install".

wall.1, last.1, mesg.1	   /usr/man/man1
inittab.5, initscript.5	   /usr/man/man5
init.8, halt.8, reboot.8,
shutdown.8, powerd.8,
killall5.8, pidof.8,
runlevel.8, sulogin.8	   /usr/man/man8

init			   /sbin/init
inittab		   	   /etc/inittab
initscript.sample          /etc/initscript.sample
telinit		   	   a link (with ln(1) ) to init, either
			   in /bin or in /sbin.
halt			   /sbin/halt
reboot			   a link to /sbin/halt in the same directory
killall5		   /sbin/killall5
pidof			   a link to /sbin/killall5 in the same directory.
runlevel		   /sbin/runlevel
shutdown		   /sbin/shutdown.
wall			   /usr/bin/wall
mesg			   /usr/bin/mesg
last			   /usr/bin/last
sulogin			   /sbin/sulogin
bootlogd		   /sbin/bootlogd
utmpdump                   don't install, it's just a debug thingy.

If you already _have_ a "wall" in /bin (the SLS release had, for example)
do _not_ install this version of wall. Chances are that the wall you are already
using is linked to /bin/write. Either first _remove_ /bin/wall before
installing the new one, or don't install the new one at all.

You might want to create a file called "/etc/shutdown.allow". Read the
manual page on shutdown to find out more about this.

Running from a read-only file system (CDROM?):
* All communication to init goes through the FIFO /run/initctl.
  There should be no problem using a read-only root file system
  If you use a Linux kernel > 1.3.66. Older kernels don't allow
  writing to a FIFO on a read-only file system.
